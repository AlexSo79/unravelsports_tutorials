ðŸŒ€ `pip install unravelsports`


ðŸŒ€ What is it?
-----

The **unravelsports** package aims to aid researchers, analysts and enthusiasts by providing intermediary steps in the complex process of turning raw sports data into meaningful information and actionable insights.

ðŸŒ€ Features
-----

- âš½ Converting **positional soccer data** into graphs to train **graph neural networks** by leveraging the powerful [**Kloppy**](https://github.com/PySport/kloppy/tree/master) data conversion standard and [**Spektral**](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/spektral) - a flexible framework for creating graph neural networks. 
- âš½ Randomizing and splitting data into **train, test and validation sets** along matches, sequences or possessions to avoid leakage and improve model quality.
- âš½ Due to the power of **Kloppy**, **unravelsports** supports these actions for _Metrica_, _Sportec_, _Tracab (CyronHego)_, _SecondSpectrum_, _SkillCorner_ and _StatsPerform_ tracking data.

ðŸŒ€ Getting Started
-----
This [**Getting Started Jupyter Notebook**](examples/getting_started.ipynb) explains how to convert any positional tracking data from **Kloppy** to **Spektral GNN** in a few easy steps while walking you through the most important features and documentation.

ðŸŒ€ Documentation
-----
For now, follow the Getting Started, more documentation will follow!
