ðŸŒ€ `pip install unravelsports`


ðŸŒ€ What is it?
-----

The **unravelsports** package aims to aid researchers, analysts and enthusiasts by providing intermediary steps in the complex process of turning raw sports data into meaningful information and actionable insights.

ðŸŒ€ Features
-----

âš½ Convert **positional soccer data** into graphs to train **graph neural networks** by leveraging the powerful [**Kloppy**](https://github.com/PySport/kloppy/tree/master) data conversion standard and [**Spektral**](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/spektral) - a flexible framework for training graph neural networks. 

âš½ Randomize and split data into **train, test and validation sets** along matches, sequences or possessions to avoid leakage and improve model quality.

âš½ Train, validate and test your (custom) Graph model(s) and easily predict on new data.

âš½ Leverage the power of **Kloppy** standardization and use **unravelsports** to execute the above for _Metrica_, _Sportec_, _Tracab (CyronHego)_, _SecondSpectrum_, _SkillCorner_ and _StatsPerform_ tracking data.

âŒ› ***More to come soon...!***

ðŸŒ€ Getting Started
-----
ðŸ“– The [**Getting Started Jupyter Notebook**](examples/0_quick_start_guide.ipynb) explains how to convert any positional tracking data from **Kloppy** to **Spektral GNN** in a few easy steps while walking you through the most important features and documentation.

ðŸ“– The [**Graph Converter Tutorial Jupyter Notebook**](examples/1_kloppy_gnn_train.ipynb) gives an in-depth walkthrough.

ðŸŒ€ Documentation
-----
For now, follow the [**Graph Converter Tutorial**](examples/1_kloppy_gnn_train.ipynb), more documentation will follow!

ðŸŒ€ Installation
----
Due to compatibility issue **unravelsports** currently only works on Python 3.11 with spektral==1.20.0 tensorflow==2.14.0 and keras==2.14.0. It is tested on the latest versions of Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows.

The easiest way to get started is by running:

```bash
pip install unravelsports
```
