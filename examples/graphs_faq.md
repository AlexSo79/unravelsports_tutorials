Before we continue it might be good to briefly explain what a Graph even in is!

A Graph is a data structure consisting of:
- Nodes: Individual elements in the graph
- Edges: Connections between nodes

The graph is typically represented by:
- [Adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix): Shows connections between nodes
- Node features: Attributes or properties of each node
- Edge features: Attributes of the connections between nodes

The image on the right represents a stylized version of a frame of tracking data in soccer.

In section 6.1 we can see what this looks like in Python.

#### D. What is a CustomGraphDataset?

<details>
    <summary><b><i> üåÄ Expand for a short explanation on CustomSpektralDataset<i></b></summary><br>

Let's have a look at the internals of our `CustomSpektralDataset`. This dataset class contains a list of graphs, available through `dataset.graphs`.

The first item in our dataset has 23 nodes, 12 features per node and 7 features per edge.

<div style="border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; background-color: ##282C34;">

```python
dataset.graphs[0]

>>> Graph(n_nodes=23, n_node_features=12, n_edge_features=7, n_labels=1)
```

The `CustomSpektralDataset` also allows us to split our data into train and test sets (and validation set if required) by using either:
- `dataset.split_test_train_validation()`
- `dataset.split_test_train()`

    <summary><b><i> üåÄ Expand for a short explanation on the representation of adjacency matrix <i></b></summary><br>

##### Adjacency Matrix
The **adjacency matrix** is represented as a [compressed sparse row matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csr_matrix), as required by Spektral. A 'normal' version of this same matrix would be of shape 23x23 filled with zero's and one's in places where two players (or ball) are connected. 

Because we set `adjacency_matrix_type='split_by_team'` and `adjacency_matrix_connect_type="ball"` this results in a total of 287 connections (ones), namely between:
- `adjacency_matrix_type='split_by_team'`:
    - All players on team A (11 * 11) 
    - All players on team B (11 * 11)
    - Ball connected to ball (1)
- `adjacency_matrix_connect_type="ball"`
    - All players and the ball (22) 
    - The ball and all players (22)

<div style="border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; background-color: ##282C34;">

>>> <Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix of dtype 'float64'
	    with 287 stored elements and shape (23, 23)>

##### Node Features
The **node features** are described using a regular Numpy array. Each column represents one feature and every row represents one player. 

The ball is presented in the last row, unless we set `random_seed=True` then every Graph gets randomly shuffled (while leaving connections in tact).

See the bullet points in **5. Load Kloppy Data, Convert and Store** to learn which column represents which feature.

The rows filled with zero's are 'empty' players created because we set `pad=True`. Graph Neural Networks are flexible enough to deal with all sorts of different graph shapes in the same dataset, normally it's not actually necessary to add these empty players, even for incomplete data with only a couple players in frame.

##### Edge Features
The **edge features** are also represented in a regular Numpy array. Again, each column represents one feature, and every row decribes the connection between two players, or player and ball.

We saw before how the **adjacency matrix** was presented in a Sparse Row Matrix with 287 rows. It is no coincidence this lines up perfectly with the **edge feature matrix**.
