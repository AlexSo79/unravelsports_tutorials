    "### 4. Graph Neural Network Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with the `GraphConverter` we need to pass two required parameters:\n",
    "- `dataset` (of type `TrackingDataset` (Kloppy)) \n",
    "- `labels` (a dict with `frame_id` as keys and a value of `{True, False, 1 or 0}`). For example {frame_id: 1, frame_id: 0}. You will need to create your own labels! In this example we'll use `dummy_labels(dataset)` to generate a fake label for each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph Identifier(s):\n",
    "When training a GNN it's highly recommended to split data into test/train(/validation) on match level, or sequence/possession level such that all values from one match/sequence/possession all end up in the same test, train or validation set. This should be done to avoid leaking information between test, train and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this simple we have two options we can pass to `GraphConverter`, namely:\n",
    "- `graph_id`. This is a single identifier (str or int) for a whole match, for example the unique match id.\n",
    "- `graph_ids`. This is a dictionary with the same keys as `labels`, but the values are now the unique identifiers. This option can be used if we want to split by sequence or possession_id. For example: {frame_id: 'matchId-sequenceId', frame_id: 'match_Id-sequenceId2'} etc. You will need to create your own possession/sequence ids. Note, if `labels` and `graph_ids` don't have the exact same keys it will throw an error. In this example we'll use the `graph_id=match_id` as the unique identifier, but feel free to change that for `graph_ids=dummy_graph_ids(dataset)` to test out that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctly splitting the final dataset in train, test and validiation sets is incorporated into `CustomSpektralDataset` (see section 7 for more information).\n",

No need to set padding because smaller and larger graphs can all be used in the same dataset. | False |\n",
